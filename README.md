# FireWatch
_(Subject to change incase of a lawsuit)_

Forest fires might increase in the near future because of extreme weather patters triggered by climate change. Homes are reduced to ashes and multiple lives are lost. Most houses aren't built to withstand wildfires. They're only designed to protect the houses from a fire that started indoors, a fire that grows slowly and might reach the building's structure.

_"A wildfire on the other hand, will attack your home from the exterior, driven by strong winds, it will reach peak temperatures in seconds, and may pass over your site and be gone within minutes, as soon as all the standing fuel is consumed. The problem then is secondary spot fires started on and within your home by wind-driven flames and embers. **If you can design your home to withstand this massive but brief exterior attack, it has a good chance of survival.**"_

# Proposed Idea
We plan on building an application that would employ computer vision and image processing techniques to alert you about the safety of your house given a few external photos and satellite images. Things such as dead vegetation, tall trees around the roof etc. would be picked up as potential hazards. Suggestions would be displayed on how to improve the defensible area around the house to withstand a wildfire based on these warnings. An example of such a suggestion would be predicting break lines around the plot to prevent a fire from spreading using satellite images of the house.

This could be used by people to prepare for incoming forest fires and potentially save lives and property if executed properly.
